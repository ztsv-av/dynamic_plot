# API Dynamic Plot

Overall plan of the project:
* I make API requests to fetch the data from stock exchange; 
* Save the necessary data to json files;
* Download the data from the json files and use to create a graph using chart.js library.

The project lacks node_modules repository, due to the size of the repository.
